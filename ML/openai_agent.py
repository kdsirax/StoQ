    Guidelines:
    1. Direct Mention (Weight 1.0): The company is named.
    2. Sector/Industry Mention (Weight 0.7-0.9): If a sector is mentioned (e.g., 'EVs', 'Banks', 'FMCG'), pull 3-5 top stocks from that sector.
    
    
    Format EXACTLY like this: TICKER|WEIGHT, TICKER|WEIGHT
    Example: ZOMATO|1.0, SWIGGY|0.9, PAYTM|0.6
    If completely irrelevant to Indian markets, return NONE.
